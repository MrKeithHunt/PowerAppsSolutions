### Person Power Apps Store Front:
- Project Summary: 
I developed this Power Apps storefront solution with the goal of sharing various canvas apps and components that I've created in my personal development environment. The initial design of the user interface was inspired by Microsoft's Appsource. Currently, the solution is a work in progress, and I plan to enhance it by adding additional screens that provide detailed information for each app, instructions on how to download them, and a comprehensive list of dependencies.

 ###   Power Apps Template App Redesign:
- Project Summary:
I started this Power Apps Template App Redesign Project to speed up the development of a Budget Tracking Solution for a customer. The template app included a series of Excel Spreadsheets that served as the data source for this app. I decided not to change that data source to the customer's data source because the customer's data source was not ready. The approach I used in redesigning this app was to simply apply a warm color palette and contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity principles to the app's UI. I also used a few containers to provide some shadow box effects and some screen responsiveness.
